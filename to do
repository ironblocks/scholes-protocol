- Refactor exercise and settle
  1. Cash out collaterals immediately after exercise or settle
  2. Cashout based on availability, not minting (actually works out the same)

- Post-expiration liquidation level
- Revise mint/burn on exercise and settlement
- Revise ability of owner to exercise/settle at expiration
- Create fee structure

Open issues to discuss:
  - Does the liquidator pay premium to the liquidated holder?
  - Fee structure
  - Collateral requirements
  - Option minting authorization filter (anyone can mint, but at restricted strikes); write discovery and authorization functions!
  - Premiums are transferred before the options, effectively the premium can be used as entry collateral
